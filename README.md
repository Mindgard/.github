# README

Mindgard is the leading provider of AI Red Teaming solutions. Spun out from over a decade of AI security research at Lancaster University and headquartered in Boston and London, Mindgard helps enterprises secure their AI models, agents, and applications across the AI lifecycle.

AI introduces risks that traditional security tools cannot detect, leaving organizations unable to find, measure, or secure their AI. Security teams struggle with a lack of visibility into AI activity and its attack surfaces. Difficulty reproducing agentic AI behavior creates uncertainty and compliance challenges. Ultimately, an inability to enforce AI controls heights the risk of compromise. 

Mindgard delivers AI detection and response through attack-driven defense, giving enterprises the ability to map their AI attack surface, measure and validate AI risk, and actively defend their AI.
